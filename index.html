  <p>Entourage is <span class="strike">arguably</span> the greatest good-time comedy out there. Watch one episode, and you'll want to watch another.</p>
  <p>Perhaps Entourage's biggest flaw is its deep list of episodes worth watching. Picking one to watch during a 30-minute window can be overwhelming.</p>
  <p>We are here to help! Just click the 'Generate a random episode!' button.</p>

    <h1 class="headline">Ari's favorite episodes</h1>
    <p>To be perfectly honest, this is more or less an impossible task. I say that because so many episodes could occupy a Top 5 at any point. This list is what I'm feeling today. Could it be different tomorrow? Absolutely.</p>
    <p>For some of my favorite quotes, go ahead and click the 'Quotes' tab at the top of the page.</p>

      <li class="eps">1. The Bat Mitzvah</li>
      <li class="eps">2. Vegas Baby, Vegas!</li>
      <li class="eps">3. The Sundance Kids</li>

    <h1 class="headline">It's more than just a show</h1>
    <p>For me, Entourage has more than entertainment value. It actually changed my life. You think that's an exaggeration? Well, it's not.</p>
    <p>When I was younger, most of my peers did not know how to pronounce my name: Ari. It's a Hebrew name. I like it. But I grew up in an Irish Catholic neighborhood. In little league, I was known as Air-ee. My name really rhymes with 'sorry'.</p>
    <p>Then Entourage -- and Ari Gold -- came along.</p>
    <p>Ari was a star character. His colorful, vulgar creativity coupled with an occasionally shown vulnerable and sweet side endeared him to viewers. Suddenly, people knew how to pronounce my name properly.</p>
    <p>So, thank you to Ari Gold and the man who created him, Doug Ellin.</p>
